## Cheft at home - first assignment at Code Institute (https://codeinstitute.net/)
<img src="assets/images/logo.JPG" style="margin: 0;">

The aim of the project is to showcase my ability to design and build a static web page using html, css and bootstrap for my first milestone project at Code Institute to becoming a Full Stack Developer. 

The focus of the project is to build a website for the audience who would like to learn how to cook and invite them to join the workshops. This is a fictional website with potential for a real business venture. In the future, this website could improve by incorporating the "how to" videos and recipe demo videos. It would also have an option for "basket" and online payment. 

## Gitpod Reminder

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:
`python3 -m http.server`

## UX
The purpose of the website is to present the information about the workshops: what they are, who they are for, what you will learn and why we are doing this. I also wanted to make sure the website is simple, easy to navigate, not overloaded with too much text and pleasant to the eye so that the user stays on the page and books a workshop.

### User Stories

* As a parent, I want to make sure its child friendly.
* As a young professional, I don't want to waste my time I don't have.
* I am vegan/vegetarian and I want to make sure the workshops are tailored to suit my diet.
* As somebody who wants to test before you buy - do I have sample recipies to try at home before going on a workshop.

I have also included "Do we need to know anything else" option, in case the user would like to share any important information we need to know or if the party size is larger than the option given or they would like more tailored service during their workshop.
