<img src="assets/images/logo.JPG" style="margin: 0;">

The aim of the project is to showcase my ability to design and build a static web page using html, css and bootstrap for my first assignment at Code Institute to becomign a Full Stack Developer. 

The focus of the project is to build a website for the audience who would like to learn how to cook and invite them to join the workshops. This is a fictional website with potential for a real business venture. In the future, this website could improve by incorporating the "how to" videos and recipe demo videos. It would also have an option for "basket" and online payment. 

## Gitpod Reminder

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:
